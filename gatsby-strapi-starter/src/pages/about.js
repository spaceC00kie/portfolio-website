    <p>It's nice to meet you! My name is Kirstie and I'm a programmer.</p>
    <p>
      I began my journey with making a simple website to help my job
      search in the customer service field. The experience was surprisingly fun
      and it yielded more interviews. I realized I could make programming my
      career rather than using it to help me find another job.

      In November of 2020 I started studying in earnest. It's been tough sometimes but rewarding.
