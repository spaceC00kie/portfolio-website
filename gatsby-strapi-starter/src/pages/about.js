    <p>It's nice to meet you! My name is Kirstie and I'm a programmer.</p>
    <p>
      I began my journey by making a personal website to support my job search
      in the customer service field. The experience of creating the site was
      surprisingly fun and it made me realize I could make programming itself my
      career.

      In November of 2020 I started studying in earnest. I started by learning
      Javascript, later completed a To Do list using react, and a full-stack
      soil senor project that runs on a raspberry pi.
